# Find-Donors-ChairtyML
CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to
provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. To expand their potential donor base,
CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to
the charity. The goal will be to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learning algorithms to
determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while under some marketing constraints.
